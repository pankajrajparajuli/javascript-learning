console.log("Entropy is the measure of disorder or randomness in a system. It is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and information theory, often associated with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. In simple terms, it suggests that natural processes tend to move towards a state of greater disorder or randomness.");
